Project Overview

In this project, a CNN is trained to classify images as either containing a dog or a cat. CNNs are powerful in image processing tasks, and this model serves as an example of how deep learning can be applied to visual data for practical use cases.
Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains labeled images of dogs and cats, which are preprocessed for input into the CNN model.
Project Structure

The main files and directories in this project include:

    Image_Classification_CNN.py - Main script for data processing, CNN construction, training, and prediction.
    README.md - Project documentation.

Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries:

bash

pip install numpy pandas tensorflow keras

Usage

    Clone this repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-classification-cnn.git
cd image-classification-cnn

Run the main script:
